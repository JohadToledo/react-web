# Portfolio v5 ![dev](https://github.com/nuIIpointerexception/www.seekvisualartist.com/actions/workflows/dev.yml/badge.svg) ![master](https://github.com/nuIIpointerexception/www.seekvisualartist.com/actions/workflows/master.yml/badge.svg)


This is my personal portfolio website. It is built with React.js and Tailwind CSS.

My goal was to try out a simplistic glass-morphism-like design and learn more about Tailwind CSS.

## Building

1. Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JohadToledo/react-web/
    ```

2. Install dependencies

## Deployment üì¶

Now you'll only need to deploy the app to your favorite hosting provider.
Personally I'd recommend [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

1. Build the app

    ```bash
    bun run build
    ```

2. Start the production server

    ```bash
    bun run start
    ```
